The public key cryptography used today will be obsolete if the quantum computer becomes a reality. However, alternative methods, called post-quantum methods, are already under study. When a quantum computer is born, its impact on cryptographic techniques deployed today will be considerable. The two features most threatened by its capabilities are public key encryption and digital signature.
Public key encryption, for example, is widely used on the Internet, in particular by protecting credit card numbers. This key is used to encrypt, but not to decrypt the number: only the recipient can retrieve the initial number using a private key, which was used to define the public key. It is theoretically possible to find the private key from the public key, but it is very difficult in practice ... except with the algorithms that a quantum computer can use.
Beyond any fantasy, the problems raised by the arrival of quantum machines, in a future more or less close, are such that the NSA has requested that research in cryptography and cryptanalysis are mainly directed towards post-quantum techniques.
The objective of this course will be, after a quick study of the main post-quantum approaches, to propose an implementation of a post-quantum cryptographic approach inspired in part by the Encoded Cryptography.
Description of the work to be carried out as part of this course:
- Acquire minimal knowledge in the field of post-quantum cryptography approaches
- Study a post-quantum cryptography scheme based on the Encoded Cryptography
- Propose a realization in C (or in Matlab) of such an algorithm based on a code of Goppa, and an LDPC code
- To study the architectures and models of associative memories developed within the
laboratory
...

Technical skills:
-C/Matlab programming
-Mathematics
-Quantum physics
-Cryptography

Ian A.D. McDonnell,nan,"In my position as Information Security Instructor at the Norwegian Defense Cyber Academy under FHS, I have three primary duties:

1. Develop and maintain the Information Security subject, as well as hold 5 ECTS worth of readings for the Academy's second year students.
2. Contributor to the development and refinement of the Academy's Cyberoperations curriculum, especially in the fields of Network Security Monitoring and Incident Response.
3. Continue to increase my own knowledge about applied InfoSec, IT infrastructure, cybersecurity, and more, through focused work and studies pertaining to my Master's degree.

Although these three duties each have been distinct in their own way, there is a considerable overlap in applicable skills and requirements as well. In order to accomplish these tasks, a good combination of technical skills, leadership, and interrelational skills is needed, which meant I could take a wholistic approach to many of the challenges presented to me. This kind of mindset appeals greatly to me, and I'm certain its application positively influenced my ability to do my job.

Primarily, my job here entailed maintaining and developing the sensor platforms used by the CSC (Cybersecurity Centre), as well as the routines and protocols associated with them. I was also an integrated part of the network forensics and real-time analysis teams when sensors were deployed, and served full-time in the mobile IR-element of the CSC.

In addition to this, I was also regularly lent to the Cyber Academy to hold lectures in Network Security Monitoring, with a specific focus on the Security Onion platform, and I've had the pleasure of leading the international NORDEFCO IR team during the Academy's Exercise Cold Matrix in 2019.

Many of my duties from my job as a Cyber Security Analyst also carried over into this role, especially those pertaining to reporting, documentation, logging and communication.
As a Cyber Security Analyst, my job was to perform Tier 1 analysis (in the MITRE cybersecurity framework) of primarily netflow and network metadata. Using various SIEM and network traffic logging and aggragation tools, my task was to analyze alerts from various sources (primarily network IDS), correlate logs and evaluate the nature of this activity. In addition, I was expected to cooperate with Tier 2 analysis and executive elements in the organization, when malicious or illegitimate activity was uncovered. This means that my job also entailed incident response processes, especially processes pertaining to the Detection &apos; Analysis stage (NIST Incident Response framework).

Another integral part of this job was efficient use of Linux CLI, to a degree Windows AD, and the ability to logically correlate data from many different sources in order to create a comprehensive understanding of the current context.

Reporting, documentation and communication/interacting on various platforms such as SharePoint, Confluence, and others, was also a central part of my duties.

During my years at the Norwegian Defense Cyber Academy, I held the rank of Konstabel (E-4 corporal). Primarily, my duties were aimed towards attaining my BA in Telematics, while also passing my NCO training. Towards this end, the Academy provided the tools, mentorship and learning environment that this process required. However, being that the Academy is a military organization, I along with my classmates were on the payroll of the Norwegian military, and then by extension considered soldiers. This meant that we were occasionally expected to fulfill certain duties unrelated to our civilian cybersecurity education, such as attending ceremonies, maintaining the unit's operational and combat readiness, and adhering to military protocol and the practical discipline that entails.

The Academy's integrated and varied program provided me with a diverse and engaging learning experience, and regularly presented challenges that were much more than just academic in nature. I was lucky to have an environment where I could press myself mentally, develop my practical leadership skills, and acquire relevant academic training towards the cybersecurity career at which I was aiming.",0

Through scrum ( Agile methodology of work ) based on the implementation of two solutions, one for supervision; NAGIOS and the other for collecting logs: ELASTIC STACK: using Elasticsearch, Kibana and elastic stack beats including: filebeat , winlogbeat , packetbeat,heartbeat and metricbeat.
The supervision solution will allow us to monitor the status of the various network equipment and systems. It will therefore be responsible for checking the availability of the servers by monitoring system resources and performance (CPU, etc.), monitoring the various services, and controlling the level detection of breakdowns of depends on IMH’s need ,so that the administrator can intervene quickly and try to this breakdown in order to ensure the continuity of operation of the network and equipment in the best possible conditions of performance.
As for the log collection solution, we are going to set up an efficient tool with a large storage capacity to be able to keep all the logs from different sources. This solution acts on data in real time. It allows us to view the logs in the form of a clear and understandable message from an ergonomic web interface, but also it gives us the possibility of creating and generating dashboards to have more visibility on the functioning of the IS. . and trying to control when suspicious activity is detected through an unsupervised machine learning based on Prelert behavioural.

Deployment of Vulnerabilities Analysis and Correlation Solution for an International Bank:
With Keystone group company:
The Tunisian International Bank (TIB) has decided to improve its security infrastructure
through the deployment of vulnerabilities analysis and correlation solution. The latter allows the
TIB to run two main complementary services:
Service 1: vulnerabilities tracking and assessment services through the exploitation of logs
returned by the vulnerability scanning solution, Maxpatrol, and their integration into an analysis
platform.
● The returned data should be stored according to a predefined format.
● The analysis and visualization of this data should be supported.
Service 2: Vulnerabilities assessment and IDS alerts
● The development of a data correlation tool that matches scanning data results with
IDS tools.
The objective is to emulate the TIB’s security infrastructure and the wide area network used for interconnection.
Therefore, you need to install and develop appropriate security solutions and services that respect
the expressed functional requirements. Finally, you need to test the robustness of these solutions
against attacks and to write a detailed report.
PROJECT OVERVIEW:
The objective of this project is to develop, implement and test a tool that correlates
vulnerabilities collected using Maxpatrol with alerts generated from an IDS to provide a smart
security solution for the TIB bank

Graduated 2011 from Télécom SudParis, Magda Chelly is one of the top 20 global influencers in Cyber Security. For her, what is the place of women in the digital field?

As human beings, we adopt technology fast. But for us - cybersecurity professionals, the way we use technology might put everyone at risk ... Yet, we are doing a fine job of alienating everyone we are trying to reach by presenting “cybersecurity” as if it were a known domain to all. The assumption that everyone from the laymen to the experts would be able to understand cybersecurity in the same way does not hold. So, is there a way to make cybersecurity simple and easy for everyone to understand? In this breezy talk, Magda shares some of her top tips to build and drive cyber intuition.

#Ransomware is not just impacting enterprise environments, as cybercriminals are also targeting industrial systems as we have seen with the recent #pipelinehack...
More and more companies are hit by cyber attacks. Is it real or just fake news? Let us delve into the facts of ransomware and its modus operandi.
Businesses keen to embrace the power of digitization must first come to terms with the value a CISO can bring. Magda Chelly explains how businesses can empower their CISOs and connect people, process and technology to quantify and address cyber risk.
I am passionate about bringing real value to the cyber security industry. This has led me to onboard on an exciting journey with Marsh Asia, building their capabilities about risk identification and risk transfer.

Cyber Security is a business risk, and not an IT problem. We keep repeating the message to our customers and leads. However, the issues lies in the fact, that cyber security industry has not matured enough to provide the solution to the problem. The solution is possible only by combining cyber security and risk quantification; an insurance expertise.

Traditionally, companies and cyber security professionals have used qualitative frameworks — red, yellow, green, or high, medium, low — to characterize cyber threats, a system also commonly used in other industries.
This approach can be quite useful, but it is no longer sufficient for companies, which has been feeling a growing need to put numbers to cyber risk, calculating both severity and likelihood. A more quantitative methodology is needed both to improve a company’s protection and to comply with increasingly stringent regulations across Asia.

Of course, this way we address the gap between business and cyber security, and brings a real value, especially to CISOs.
Cybersecurity in Industrial Control Systems is fascinating and requires an effective strategy to address the emerging and legacy threats.
Every day approximately we have 17000 new vulnerabilities or technical weaknesses disclosed by vendors in average, and more than 300,000 new malware.
This is why and how risk quantification presents the best of solutions. Understand your exposures, and being able to clarify and quantify how much/long your business might be affected will be your best way forward.
In the current environment, organizations are exposing their digital assets to new cyber risks. COVID-19 themed phishing emails and malware are on the rise, increasing exposure from within. Organizations are also struggling to implement newly required controls in a timely fashion. The balance between security, privacy, and flexibility seems more delicate and complex than ever before.
