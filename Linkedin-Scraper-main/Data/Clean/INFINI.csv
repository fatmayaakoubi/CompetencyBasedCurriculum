This project is a kind of art that contains movement perceivable by the viewer or that connects on motion for its effect. This is the definition of kinetic art. While the definition explains the practical notion, it doesn’t emphasize the hypnotic capabilities of the art form. And though it includes any medium, it’s actually a kinetic sculpture that most comes to mind when thinking of the genre. The mechanism of this project depends on the motion of many wires connected with each other so if a special rotation happened to the wires, then the particles will start moving like a wave
this is a project showing a simple system for the sculpture.

Michaël Cailloux,nan,"Michaël Cailloux’s work is inspired by nature and colors. He draws his inspiration from 17th century still life and art nouveau naturalism and his body of work has been described as “modern baroque” by Télérama. The essential part of Michaël Cailloux’s work starts with drawings with thin tip pens and his signature symbol is the fly.

Michaël Cailloux has been passionate about drawing since childhood and could never stop sketching and doodling everywhere he went. He graduated from the renowned École Duperré School of Design in Paris in 1998 with a dissertation dedicated entirely to the 18th century beauty mark, also called la mouche (French for “a fly”).

The following year he launched the company Atelier LZC that created unique and tailor-made commission pieces for prestigious brands such as Baccarat, Cartier, Habitat, Van Cleef & Arpels, S.T. Dupont...

In 2009, the artist began exploring new creative fields and expanded his skill set by training in jewelry making and etching. And thus was born his concept of misappropriation straight out of his imagination, creating meticulously sculpted and engraved copper Wall Jewelry, along with their etchings. The fly, a symbol of both life and death with references to still life paintings of the 17th century, became his signature.

Since 2014, his artistic work is regularly exhibited in galleries in Paris, London and Tokyo.

In 2017, he stood out with the publishing of Merveilleuse Nature by Éditions Thierry Magnier, a meticulously crafted book and a true work of art in its own right, recommended by the contemporary art magazine ""L’oeil"".

Concurrently, Michaël Cailloux pursued his passion for design by creating his own capsule collections as well as designs in collaboration with brands like Dior (2016), Lenôtre (2018), Bernardaud (2020) and Shideido (2021).

A refined body of work, highlighted in numerous magazines.
Michaël Cailloux is an 44 year old artist and designer. He draws for dinnerware, books and more. He lives in Paris, France, with his spouse.

The essence of Wany is anchored above all in its raison d’être: “Free the infinite potential of African youth by educating and mobilizing it around the United Nations 2030 Agenda”. To achieve these goals, Wany is a pan-African digital platform that connects in the spirit of African youth the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) and the CSR actions of companies present in Africa.

Thus Wany educates and mobilizes African youth around the 17 SDGs. Indeed, in 2020, 77% of the African population is under 35 or 1 billion. The role of African youth is therefore critical to the achievement of Agenda 2030. And as Antonio Guterres, Secretary-General of the United Nations, recalled: “If Africa does not realize the SDGs, the world will not realize the SDGs.”

Fati Souggane,nan,"Good morning.

Here I present my 3 flagship tools:

Human Design is a reading that tells us who we are really, innately, when we are not conditioned.
Unlike the personality tests, which they rely on a ""T moment"" and tell us who we are at the moment when we answer the questions regarding what we are aware, under our conditioning, of the Human Design, about him, gives us our own conscious and unconscious mode of operation and tells us how we are influenced and conditioned by the outside world. It is a powerful tool of self-knowledge, based on a combination of traditional and modern sciences, which gives us the keys to listen to our inner guidance rather than our mind, in order to make better decisions, so as to have the least resistance possible and that life is easier, fluid and pleasant.

The InfiniTM Success method is a very concrete, precise and just energy release method that puts the finger directly on what you need to transform. It allows you to identify the source of your unconscious obstacles and blockages that bore you daily.
We identify your unconscious blockages and release them at the energy level on all levels.
With the method, we work on emotions, beliefs and energy, which creates a profound transformation.

The energy care LaHoChi acts on the body, emotions and spirit and it brings us on the path of well-being.
The very high energy vibration that it brings, gradually allows us to increase our vibratory rate and our consciousness and it is through the enlargement of our consciousness that the Lahochi allows us to advance on ourselves.
The energy revival restores joy of living, confidence and allows to free themselves from stress, anxiety, to regain serenity and to renew with oneself and others.
