I was part of a team of interns who implemented an information system for catering companies that helps manage their assets while supervising their KPIs. 
We migrated the frontend from PHP and jQuery to the Angular framework which resulted in a much better user-experience. 
I personally worked on the application deployment on Amazon Web Services and the implementation of the CI/CD pipeline. the project was using a microservices architecture therefore I created a docker image for each of the microservices and used Nginx as a reverse proxy for the backend server. 
I was also in charge of securing the API endpoint and for this I used Json Web Tokens (JWT). 
This internship was implemented remotely since the company was based in Canada therefore we used Microsoft teams for communications and documents sharing and we used jira software to manage tickets and the SCRUM board.
Skills: Amazon Web Services (AWS) · Angular · Docker · Continuous Integration and Continuous Delivery (CI/CD) · Teamwork · Laravel
This is an interface I implemented that prompts the user with a security question if he logs in from an unregistered device.
This is an interface I implemented that allows the user to view which devices logged into his account and when they did.

I implemented a Human resources management application using Laravel PHP, MySQL as a database management system and the Model-View-Controller model (MVC).
The application allowed employees to submit leave requests , view how many leave days they have left and access their own contract and personal information.  
The admin can view a list of the employees and mark their presence for the current day. he can also process the leave requests and automatically generate a work certificate for the employees. 
This work was implemented remotely due to the covid-19 pandemic and I communicated with the team using skype and slack.
Skills: Laravel · Human Resources Information Systems (HRIS) · MySQL · PHP · Calendars · Self Learning
In this interface, the admin can process leave requests and view the list of personnel who are on leave.

During this internship, I inspected the ""Radès C""  combined-cycle power plant and I was introduced to the work environment of the Tunisian state-owned electric and natural gas utility company (Société Tunisienne de l'Electricité et du Gaz,""STEG"").  
I was able to attend preliminary tests of the 450MW natural gas-fired plant and the intricate unit and functional tests made to monitor and tune the machinery in the site. 
I was also able to inspect various fields of engineering in the site including but not limited to: Quality Control, Civil engineering, mechanic engineering and electric engineering.

Louage.tn, the first information system for ""Louage"" in Tunisia.

This work, carried out within the company Just Smart, is part of the graduation project to obtain the National Diploma in Computer Engineer at ESPRIT. It consists in digitizing the traditional procedure of the “Louage” reservation in Tunisia and this through the establishment of an information system which includes a Web application for the administrative management, and two mobile applications: one for the drivers, and one for the passengers.
This system will allow drivers to publish their trips in advance, and passengers to book their seats according to their desired destinations and dates. Thereby, drivers will be able to know in advance the number of booked seats for each station, and passengers will guarantee their seats on board even before arriving at the station.

This project is a kind of art that contains movement perceivable by the viewer or that relies on motion for its effect. This is the definition of kinetic art. While the definition explains the practical notion, it doesn’t emphasize the hypnotic capabilities of the art form. And though it comprises any medium, it’s actually a kinetic sculpture that most comes to mind when thinking of the genre. The mechanism of this project depends on the motion of many wires connected with each other so if a special rotation happened to the wires, then the particles will start moving like a wave
this is a project showing a simple system for the sculpture.

It’s easy to have FAITH everything is going to work out, when everything IS working out.
It’s much harder to have faith when you are facing challenges in your life. But that is exactly when you need to apply your faith. Because faith is believing in the unseen. Faith is taking the first step. Faith is jumping in the deep end and KNOWING everything will be OK. It’s easy to be positive when everything is working out… It’s much harder, much much harder when nothing is working out.. But that’s when we need it the most.
