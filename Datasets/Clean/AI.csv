- Detection of toxic opinions: A classification model has been refined that can discern toxic comments to make it easier for the administrator to filter unnecessary opinions.
- The Feedback Classification: The goal is to determine the topics of messages sent by customers to determine their intentions. To do this, we created a KMeans message clustering model.
- Stock optimization: The aim is to improve the position of the supply chain by providing for future sales of products based on online sales history. The final model is a RNN with LSTM cells.
- Customer segmentation: For this reason, a DNN model has been used to encode users according to their interactions with products to a multidimensional space to generate User Representations. Finally, we gather the Customers with a Kmeans clustering model.
- The recommended engine: This system is based on collaborative filtering, which is used to predict the rating or preference a user assigns to an element based on the preferences of other users.

Candriam is an asset manager. The need was expressed from a catbot Teams multilangue to consult the business information. A tool exists internally, but it is difficult to access information, there is a large tree and several tabs. Users have had a hard time looking for information, which causes many requests from the support team. The boot must allow to return the information in a simple, less stringent way, and thus relieve the support.

Detail mission:
• Creation of a chatbot Teams allowing the consultation of four types of information on the funds.
• Support of English and French.
• Implementing a web service data to retrieve data via a simple API call.
• Compliance with security standards specific to the Asset Manager in a Public Cloud environment.

This project is a kind of art that contains movement perceivable by the viewer or that connects on motion for its effect. This is the definition of kinetic art. While the definition explains the practical notion, it doesn’t emphasize the hypnotic capabilities of the art form. And though it includes any medium, it’s actually a kinetic sculpture that most comes to mind when thinking of the genre. The mechanism of this project depends on the motion of many wires connected with each other so if a special rotation happened to the wires, then the particles will start moving like a wave
this is a project showing a simple system for the sculpture.

Work on the mission BepiColombo. The subject of my internship is ""analysis of the AOCS of an interplanetary probe in mode orbit control."" I have been in charge of two main tasks. The first one was to tune the controller of the OCM (Orbit Control Mode) of the BepiColombo program and the second one was validate the functions for the thruster modulator.

The first part is to analyze the open-loop and the closed-loop of the OCM and to tune the controllers to be compliant with all the requirements given by the internal customer (gain margin, phase margin, time performance, etc ...). This analysis is done with Matlab and Simulink.

The second part is to test in C language the functions of the modulator controlling the thrusters during this mode and correct it.

During this internship, I was in charge of the development of a method of test in production based on the HALT / HASS (Highly Accelerated Life Test / Highly Accelerated Stress Screen). The purpose of this method is to detect latent defects potentially present in some parts at the end of the production chain. To do this, each finished product is subjected to vibratory stresses predefined in a 6 axis shaker (3 translations and 3 rotations). This way, the parts having problems are identified.

My mission was to develop a generic method for defining the stress profile required to detect these defects without reducing the performance of the good products.

The method that I put in place consists in submitting a prototype considered as perfect (no latent defect) to vibratory constraints and calculate the PSD (Power Spectral Density) in several places in this prototype until the failure of the product. These PSD are then converted into FDS (Fatigue Damage Spectrum). An FDS ""reference"" corresponding to 2 % of FDS leading to the destruction of the product is then calculated and corresponds to the vibration profile that has not to be exceeded during the test in production. This way, the tests will not damage the life of the finished product more than 2 %. All these studies are complemented with a fine element analysis thanks to Nastran, Ansys or Abaqus to know the critical resonance frequencies.",0
